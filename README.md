## Project Overview

This project is a **Mandelbrot set visualizer** implemented in **p5.js**, focused on pixel-level rendering and mathematical clarity.

The visualization is generated by directly implementing the **escape-time algorithm**, mapping each pixel of the canvas to a point in the complex plane and iterating the function

zₙ₊₁ = zₙ² + c

until divergence or a fixed iteration limit is reached.

Color values are assigned based on the number of iterations required for divergence.  
A precomputed HSB color palette is used to produce smooth gradients and highlight fractal boundaries.

The program includes an **automatic zoom-in mechanism** that progressively focuses on a fixed point in the complex plane, revealing the self-similar structure of the Mandelbrot set over time.

All rendering is performed on the CPU using direct pixel buffer manipulation (`loadPixels` / `updatePixels`), without the use of shaders or external fractal libraries.
